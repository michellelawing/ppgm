This folder contains the data and code for the analysis in Rivera et al (2020) and Lawing et al (2016)
This version of the code was functional in 2016, however this code will not run on the latest version of ppgm. We preserve it here for posterity in case readers wish to examine how the analyses were initially executed.

The current version of ppgm contains working versions of these functions, and we are actively developing vignettes in order to clarify the ppgm workflow.
