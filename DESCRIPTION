Description: Reconstruction of paleoclimate niches using phylogenetic comparative 
    methods and projection reconstructed niches onto paleoclimate maps.
    The user can specify various models of trait evolution or estimate the best fit
    model, include fossils, use one or multiple phylogenies for inference, and make
    animations of shifting suitable habitat through time. This model was first used
    in Lawing and Polly (2011), and further implemented in Lawing et al (2016) and 
    Rivera et al (2020).
